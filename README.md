Work experience 

I formally started my potential career at Star Nissan Vereeninging as an F and I assistant, where I help work on the closing and structuring of car deals in 2019. At the start of 2020 I was employed by atm solutions as a reconciliations clerk in the treasury department where I was responsible for maintaining the floats of the company with all clients as well as working closely with Security providers like G4s and Fidelity. At the end of 2021 I was promoted into my current role as claims specialist, where I deal with all the claims that may arise from day-to-day activities regarding the Atms and ensuring that all atm are in balance any differences are accounted for banks like ABSA. 

Some of the projects I worked on include

Neural network  
Basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Sentiment Analysis by using different neural networks in Keras to try and classify a book review as eitherpositive or negative, and report on which network type worked better. 
For example, consider the review, "This book is not very good.'' This text ends with 
the words "very good" which indicates a very positive sentiment, but it is negated 
because it is preceded by the word "not", so the text should be classified as having 
a negative sentiment. The neural network can recognize and classify the review correctly
